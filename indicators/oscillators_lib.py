""" 
 Generally speaking, momentum measures the rate-of-change of a security's price. 
 As the price of a security rises, price momentum increases. 
 The faster the security rises 
 (the greater the period-over-period price change), 
the larger the increase in momentum. Once this rise begins to slow, 
momentum will also slow.

    The Momentum Technical Indicator measures the amount that a 
    security's price has changed over a given time span. 
    It is used with the closed price
     There are several variations of the momentum indicator,
     but whichever version is used, the momentum (M) is a
     comparison between the current closing price (CP) a closing price 
     "n" periods ago (CPn). The "n" is determined by you. 
     In the attached chart, Momentum is set to "10," so the indicator 
     is comparing the current price to the price 10 time instances ago
