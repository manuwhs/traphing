    "- **tests/**: A set of Unit tests for the traphing library. They are meant to be run with pytest.\n",

    "- **notebooks/**: A set of notebooks that explain the core elments of the library.\n",

    "- README.md: Text file containing the description of the traphing library to be displayed in Github.\n",
